            <h2>The Impact</h2>
            <p>A period piece is defined as a body of work that is set in or strongly reminiscent of an earlier historical era. Films set in earlier times are an experience that transports viewers into moments from long ago–one crucial variable to bring this experience to life and enthrall the eye being costume design. In a modern setting, the work of a costume designer would be to curate looks that reflect the character’s identity, convey development, and transform the actor into an authentic being on screen. But in a period piece–on top of establishing tone, time, place, and designing for characterization–there are traditionally two approaches of design: accuracy or artistry in coordination with the creative vision of the project. When capturing a time period, costume designers will often opt for reflecting the spirit of the time by grounding their design with historical roots, in addition to stylizing variables to contribute to the overall imagery of the film and visually connect directly to the audience.</p>
